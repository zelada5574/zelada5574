DATA ANALYTICS GOOGLE CAPSTONE PROJECT: DVY Bikeshare Data

Objective (Ask Phase)
To analyse how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to determine the best marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Prepare Phase
The data was downloaded directly from the Divvy Bikes website: https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data

It was organised by month, and assumed to be credible since it was compiled and published by the organisation.

Process Phase
After importing the data, the first step was to inspect the data for anomalies. A new column for trip_time_mins was created. Nulls were removed from the dataset. A full description of the process is described in the Update Cyclistic Case Study SQL file.

Analyse Phase
In this phase, queries were created to uncover trends that were highlighted in the data visualisations.

Share Phase
Visualisations were created using Tableau. Published here https://public.tableau.com/views/Bikesharevisualizations/TotalTripsmade?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

Act Phase
A powerpoint presentation was compiled - Cyclistic - Cyclistic Case Study.pptx
