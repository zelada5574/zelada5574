/* 

This will be my SQL code used to import, combine, prepare, process, and analyse the Cyclistic Case Study for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. 

All data was pulled from DIVY bikes by Motivate Internationl under their license. https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data

MYSQL was the database used for this project

My steps for this Case Study were:

1. Creating a dataset 
2. Downloading the previous year worth of data from DVY bikes
3. Importing each indiviudal years data into their own seperate table
4. Combining all tables into one
5. Scanning the table created for various errors
6. Removing data with errors
7. Saving cleaned data to be visualized within Tableau

Code begins on step 4

----------------Step 4: Combining all tables into one one Table--------------

SELECT *, 
FROM (
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2021_04`
  UNION ALL 
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2021_05`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2021_07`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2021_08`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2021_09`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2021_10`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2021_11`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2021_12`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2022_01`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2022_02`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT* FROM `bikeshare-347503.bikeshare.2022_03`) AS Combined

SELECT ended_at, started_at, (ended_at - started_at) * 1440 AS Trip_Length_mins
FROM Combined


-------------STEP 5: Scanning the table created for various errors----------------------

SELECT DISTINCT(member_casual
FROM Combined
 
SELECT ride_id, count(*) 
FROM  Combined
GROUP BY ride_id
HAVING count(*)>1

SELECT rideable_type, count(*)
FROM divvy_tripdata
GROUP by rideable_type

SELECT min (end_lng), max(end_lng), min (end_lat), max(end_lat), min (start_lng), max(start_lng), min (start_lat), max(start_lat)
FROM Combined

SELECT *
FROM Combined 
WHERE start_station_name IS NOT NULL 
AND start_station_id IS NOT NULL
AND end_station_name IS NOT NULL
AND end_station_id IS NOT NULL
AND ride_id IS NOT NULL
AND rideable_type IS NOT NULL
AND start_lat IS NOT NULL
AND start_lng IS NOT NULL
AND end_lat IS NOT NULL
AND end_lng IS NOT NULL
AND member_casual IS NOT NULL

/*The above code could be written as individual columns are filtered out if it is NULL to find those rows with errors */

SELECT end_station_id, end_station_name, count(*)
FROM divvy_tripdata
GROUP BY end_station_id, end_station_name

-------------STEP 6: Removing the data with errors----------------------
