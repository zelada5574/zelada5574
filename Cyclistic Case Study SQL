/* 

This will be my SQL code used to import, combine, prepare, process, and analyse the Cyclistic Case Study for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. 

All data was pulled from DIVY bikes by Motivate Internationl under their license. https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data

MYSQL was the database used for this project

My steps for this Case Study were:

1. Creating a dataset 
2. Downloading the previous year worth of data from DVY bikes
3. Importing each indiviudal years data into their own seperate table
4. Combining all tables into one
5. Scanning the table created for various errors
6. Removing data with errors
7. Saving cleaned data to be visualized within Tableau

Code begins on step 4

SELECT ended_at, started_at, (ended_at - started_at) * 1440 AS Trip_Length_mins

-------------STEP 5: Scanning the table created for various errors----------------------

SELECT DISTINCT(member_casual

/*The above code could be written as individual columns filtered out if it is NULL to find those rows with errors */

SELECT end_station_id, end_station_name, count(*)
FROM Combined
GROUP BY end_station_id, end_station_name

-------------STEP 6: Removing the data with errors----------------------

--exclude cases where start time is greater than end time
SELECT count(1)
FROM Combined
WHERE started_at >= ended_at

UPDATE Combined
SET exclude = 'Y'
WHERE started_at >= ended_at;

--exclude cases where trip length less than or equal to 0
SELECT *
FROM Combined
ORDER BY trip_length_mins asc;

UPDATE Combined
SET exclude = 'Y'
TRIP trip_length_mins <= 0;

SELECT *
FROM Combined
W HERE exclude is null
ORDER BY trip_length_mins asc;

SELECT trip_length_mins, count(1)
FROM Combined
WHERE exclude is null
GROUP by trip_length_mins;

SELECT count(1)
FROM Combined
WHERE exclude is null
